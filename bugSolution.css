Several solutions exist to resolve the specificity issue:

**1. Adjusting Selector Order:** Reordering the selectors in your CSS can impact specificity. Placing the more specific selector earlier can resolve the issue:

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}
```

**2. Using More Specific Selectors (Where appropriate):** If possible, add extra specificity to your target selectors so that you can have the expected result without overriding. This way you don't need to change the order.

**3. Using `!important` (generally discouraged):**  The `!important` flag forces a declaration to override any other declarations. However, overuse of `!important` reduces CSS maintainability.  Consider this a last resort:

```css
p {
  color: red !important;
}
```

The most effective method is often a combination of the above approaches.  Carefully reviewing the intended styling hierarchy and selector specificity will lead to predictable and robust CSS.
