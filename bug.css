The CSS specificity can lead to unexpected styling behavior.  For example, consider the following:

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}
```

In this case, the `div p` selector has higher specificity than the `p` selector, so the paragraph text will be blue even though the `p` selector is defined later. This is a common source of confusion for those new to CSS.
